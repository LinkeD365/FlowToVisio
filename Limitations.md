# Limitations

### Unknown Actions

The tool is only as good as the actions it knows about. As Microsoft introduce new actions, or alter the older ones, it is difficult to keep up. Please let me know if there are things missing by creating an [issue](https://github.com/LinkeD365/FlowToVisio/issues).Â 

If the code does not know about a particular action, it will be a plain action with no colour or logo

### Overlapping

When the Visio diagram is created, there will be some overlapping lines or even actions, as the layout method is simple. Anyone who can offer a solution, let me know
